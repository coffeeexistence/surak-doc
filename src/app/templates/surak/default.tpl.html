             To install a package in Surak, run: <span class="code">bower install package-name --save</span><br />
             Then locate the package's folder in <i>vendor/project-name</i>.<br />
             Choose the file that you would like to include, which will usually be <i>vendor/project-name/project-name.min.js</i>.<br />
             Then add that to the <span class="red">"dependencies"</span> array in <i>surak.json</i>, which is in the project root.<br />

             <span class="red">"dependencies"</span> is where grunt looks when concatenating it's assets.<br />
             The order in which dependencies are loaded matter, so make sure to order them correctly!

             Out of all the files provided by Surak, you will only really need to focus on the ones in green.

             <h3 class="thin">Dist:</h3>
             <i>Dist</i> contains all production-ready files, including the html index, minified javascript and css, and images.<br />
             <i>index.html</i> is the only text file here that you will be modifying, everything else will be generated by grunt.<br />

             <h3 class="thin">Src:</h3>
             <i>Src</i> contains all of the javascipt and css source files.<br />

             <h3 class="thin">Vendor:</h3>
             <i>Vendor</i> contains all of libraries that your app depends on<br />
             This folder is the Bower installation directory, everything here should first be installed through <br />
             <span class="code">bower install package-name --save</span> or by manually adding it
             to the <i>dependencies</i> array in <i>bower.json</i>.<br />
             Unless you are having issues with version conflicts, you don't need to have this in your app's repo.

             <h3 class="thin">Surak.json:</h3>
             <i>surak.json</i> is currently used for managing which 3rd party libraries are concatenated into app.min.js.
